### Dump1090-fa Docker image for RPI

Dumb1090 is a Mode S decoder specifically designed for RTL-SDR devices. This rework was inspirated by [this repository](https://github.com/jeanralphaviles/dump1090-docker), and it allows to easily run dump1090-fa in a Raspberry Pi device using Docker.

#### How to use

Just use the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker-compose up -d dump1090
```
